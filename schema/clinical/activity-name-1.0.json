It is recommended that the activity(ies) name(s) be drawn from this extensive list based on CDC guidelines to facilitate mapping to standard energy expenditure values (METs). Note that the CPA compendium lists standard METs intended for use in population-level epidemiological research, not for individual use which should be corrected for sex and BMI. The CDC table is more useful for this application because the categories are broad (moderate, vs. vigorous) and it doesnâ€™t pretend to have the precision that the CPA compendium does.",
