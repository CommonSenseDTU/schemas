    "description": "The modified Borg scale is a self-report measure on the subjective feeling of breathlessness or fatigue associated with a current physical activity (Borg, G. (1970). The 0-10 scale is the ‘modified’ Borg scale; the original perceived exertion scale was scored from 6-20 (corresponding to heart rate range of 60-200). The modified Borg scale as a perceived symptom scale can be used to rate various symptoms associated with exercise (e.g., breathlessness, muscle fatigue).",
